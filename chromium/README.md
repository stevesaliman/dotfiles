To change the colors in Chromium, edit `chrome-theme/manifest.json`, or go to chrometheme.studio, 
set up a theme, download it, unzip it, and replace the manifest.json we've already got.

Then Go to chrome://extensions, enable developer mode, click "Load unpacked" and choose the 
chrome-theme directory.
