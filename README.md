This project has submodules.  This means that the first time you clone the 
project, you'll need to run

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then, to update the plugins at anytime, just do:

```
git submodule update --recursive
```

You still need to add/generate ssh keys.  I'm not checking those in a public 
repo.
